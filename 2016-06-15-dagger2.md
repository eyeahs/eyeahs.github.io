## 그래프 만들기

@Inject와 @Provides 어노테이션된 클래스들은 그들의 의존들(dependencies)로 연결된, 객체들의 그래프를 형성한다. 애플리케이션의 main 메소드나 Android Application같은 호출 코드는 잘 정의된 근본 집합(roots of set)을 통해 그 그래프에 접근한다. Dagger2에서, 그 집합(set)은 인수(argument)를 가지지 않으며 요구하는 타입을 반환하는 메소드를 가진 인터페이스에 의해 정의된다. 그런 인터페이스에 @Component 어노테이션을 적용하고 module들의 파라미터에 module 타입들을 전달하면, Dagger2는 그 계약의 구현을 완전히 생성한다.

    @Component(modules = DripCoffeeModule.class)
    interface CoffeeShop {
      CoffeeMaker maker();
    }

이것의 구현은 인터페이스의 이름 앞에 'Dagger'를 추가한 이름을 가진다. 그것의 구현에 있는 builder() 메소드를 호출해 인스턴스를 얻는다. 그리고 의존들을 설정하기 위해 반환된 builder를 사용한 뒤 build()로 새로운 인스턴스를 만든다.

    CoffeeShop coffeeShop = DaggerCoffeeShop.builder()
        .dripCoffeeModule(new DripCoffeeModule())
        .build();

Note: 만약 당신의 @Component가 최상위 타입이 아니라면, 생성된 component의 이름은 밑줄(underscore)로 연결된 외부(enclosing) 타입들의 이름들을 포함할 것이다. 예를 들어 이 코드는:

    class Foo {
      static class Bar {
        @Component
        interface BazComponent {}
      }
    }

DaggerFoo_Bar_Baz라는 이름을 가진 component를 생성할 것이다.

기본 생성자로 접근가능한 모듈은 설정할 것이 없다면 builder가 자동으로 인스턴스를 생성할 것이므로 생략할 수 있다. 그리고 @provides 메소드가 모두 static인 모듈을 위해 구현은 인스턴스를 전혀 필요로 하지 않는다. 만약 모든 의존들이 사용자가 의존(dependency) 인스턴스를 생성하지 않고
만약 모든 의존들이 사용자가 의존(dependency)의 인스턴스를 생성하지 않고 생성될 수 있다면, 생성된 구현은 builder를 다루지 않고 새로운 인스턴스를 얻기 위해 사용할 수 있는 create() 메소드를 가질 것이다.

    CoffeeShop coffeeShop = DaggerCoffeeShop.create();
    
이제, 우리의 CoffeeApp은 완전히 주입된 CoffeeMaker를 간단하게 얻기 위해 Dagger가 생성한 CoffeShop의 구현을 사용할 수 있다.

    public class CoffeeApp {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        CoffeeShop coffeeShop = DaggerCoffeeShop.create();
        coffeeShop.maker().brew();
      }
    }

그래프가 생성되고 진입점은 주입되었으니, coffer maker 앱을 실행한다. Fun.

    $ java -cp ... coffee.CoffeeApp
    ~ ~ ~ heating ~ ~ ~
    => => pumping => =>
    [_]P coffee! [_]P


# Bindings in the graph

The example above shows how to construct a component with some of the more typcial bindings, but there are a variety of mechanisms for contributing bindings to the graph. The following are available as dependencies and may be used to generate a well-formed component:

Those declared by @Provides methods within a @Module referenced directly by @Component.modules or transitively via @Module.includes
Any type with an @Inject constructor that is unscoped or has a @Scope annotation that matches one of the component’s scopes
The component provision methods of the component dependencies
The component itself
Unqualified builders for any included subcomponent
Provider or Lazy wrappers for any of the above bindings
A Provider of a Lazy of any of the above bindings (e.g., Provider<Lazy<CoffeeMaker>>)
A MembersInjector for any type
Singletons and Scoped Bindings

Annotate an @Provides method or injectable class with @Singleton. The graph will use a single instance of the value for all of its clients.

@Provides @Singleton static Heater provideHeater() {
  return new ElectricHeater();
}
The @Singleton annotation on an injectable class also serves as documentation. It reminds potential maintainers that this class may be shared by multiple threads.

@Singleton
class CoffeeMaker {
  ...
}
Since Dagger 2 associates scoped instances in the graph with instances of component implementations, the components themselves need to declare which scope they intend to represent. For example, it wouldn’t make any sense to have a @Singleton binding and a @RequestScoped binding in the same component because those scopes have different lifecycles and thus must live in components with different lifecycles. To declare that a component is associated with a given scope, simply apply the scope annotation to the component interface.

@Component(modules = DripCoffeeModule.class)
@Singleton
interface CoffeeShop {
  CoffeeMaker maker();
}
Components may have multiple scope annotations applied. This declares that they are all aliases to the same scope, and so that component may include scoped bindings with any of the scopes it declares.

Reusable scope

Sometimes you want to limit the number of times an @Inject-constructed class is instantiated or a @Provides method is called, but you don’t need to guarantee that the exact same instance is used during the lifetime of any particular component or subcomponent. This can be useful in environments such as Android, where allocations can be expensive.

For these bindings, you can apply @Reusable scope. @Reusable-scoped bindings, unlike other scopes, are not associated with any single component; instead, each component that actually uses the binding will cache the returned or instantiated object.

That means that if you install a module with a @Reusable binding in a component, but only a subcomponent actually uses the binding, then only that subcomponent will cache the binding’s object. If two subcomponents that do not share an ancestor each use the binding, each of them will cache its own object. If a component’s ancestor has already cached the object, the subcomponent will reuse it.

There is no guarantee that the component will call the binding only once, so applying @Reusable to bindings that return mutable objects, or objects where it’s important to refer to the same instance, is dangerous. It’s safe to use @Reusable for immutable objects that you would leave unscoped if you didn’t care how many times they were allocated.

@Reusable // It doesn't matter how many scoopers we use, but don't waste them.
class CoffeeScooper {
  @Inject CoffeeScooper() {}
}

@Module
class CashRegisterModule {
  @Provides
  @Reusable // DON'T DO THIS! You do care which register you put your cash in.
            // Use a specific scope instead.
  static CashRegister badIdeaCashRegister() {
    return new CashRegister();
  }
}


@Reusable // DON'T DO THIS! You really do want a new filter each time, so this
          // should be unscoped.
class CoffeeFilter {
  @Inject CoffeeFilter() {}
}

Lazy injections

Sometimes you need an object to be instantiated lazily. For any binding T, you can create a Lazy<T> which defers instantiation until the first call to Lazy<T>’s get() method. If T is a singleton, then Lazy<T> will be the same instance for all injections within the ObjectGraph. Otherwise, each injection site will get its own Lazy<T> instance. Regardless, subsequent calls to any given instance of Lazy<T> will return the same underlying instance of T.

class GridingCoffeeMaker {
  @Inject Lazy<Grinder> lazyGrinder;

  public void brew() {
    while (needsGrinding()) {
      // Grinder created once on first call to .get() and cached.
      lazyGrinder.get().grind();
    }
  }
}
Provider injections

Sometimes you need multiple instances to be returned instead of just injecting a single value. While you have several options (Factories, Builders, etc.), one option is to inject a Provider<T> instead of just T. A Provider<T> invokes the binding logic for T each time .get() is called. If that binding logic is an @Inject constructor, a new instance will be created, but a @Provides method has no such guarantee.

class BigCoffeeMaker {
  @Inject Provider<Filter> filterProvider;

  public void brew(int numberOfPots) {
  ...
    for (int p = 0; p < numberOfPots; p++) {
      maker.addFilter(filterProvider.get()); //new filter every time.
      maker.addCoffee(...);
      maker.percolate();
      ...
    }
  }
}
Note: Injecting Provider<T> has the possibility of creating confusing code, and may be a design smell of mis-scoped or mis-structured objects in your graph. Often you will want to use a factory or a Lazy<T> or re-organize the lifetimes and structure of your code to be able to just inject a T. Injecting Provider<T> can, however, be a life saver in some cases. A common use is when you must use a legacy architecture that doesn’t line up with your object’s natural lifetimes (e.g. servlets are singletons by design, but only are valid in the context of request-specfic data).

Qualifiers

Sometimes the type alone is insufficient to identify a dependency. For example, a sophisticated coffee maker app may want separate heaters for the water and the hot plate.

In this case, we add a qualifier annotation. This is any annotation that itself has a @Qualifier annotation. Here’s the declaration of @Named, a qualifier annotation included in javax.inject:

@Qualifier
@Documented
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Named {
  String value() default "";
}
You can create your own qualifier annotations, or just use @Named. Apply qualifiers by annotating the field or parameter of interest. The type and qualifier annotation will both be used to identify the dependency.

class ExpensiveCoffeeMaker {
  @Inject @Named("water") Heater waterHeater;
  @Inject @Named("hot plate") Heater hotPlateHeater;
  ...
}
Supply qualified values by annotating the corresponding @Provides method.

@Provides @Named("hot plate") static Heater provideHotPlateHeater() {
  return new ElectricHeater(70);
}

@Provides @Named("water") static Heater provideWaterHeater() {
  return new ElectricHeater(93);
}
Dependencies may not have multiple qualifier annotations.

Compile-time Validation

The Dagger annotation processor is strict and will cause a compiler error if any bindings are invalid or incomplete. For example, this module is installed in a component, which is missing a binding for Executor:

@Module
class DripCoffeeModule {
  @Provides static Heater provideHeater(Executor executor) {
    return new CpuHeater(executor);
  }
}
When compiling it, javac rejects the missing binding:

[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR :
[ERROR] error: java.util.concurrent.Executor cannot be provided without an @Provides-annotated method.
Fix the problem by adding an @Provides-annotated method for Executor to any of the modules in the component. While @Inject, @Module and @Provides annotations are validated individually, all validation of the relationship between bindings happens at the @Component level. Dagger 1 relied strictly on @Module-level validation (which may or may not have reflected runtime behavior), but Dagger 2 elides such validation (and the accompanying configuration parameters on @Module) in favor of full graph validation.

Compile-time Code Generation

Dagger’s annotation processor may also generate source files with names like CoffeeMaker_Factory.java or CoffeeMaker_MembersInjector.java. These files are Dagger implementation details. You shouldn’t need to use them directly, though they can be handy when step-debugging through an injection. The only generated types you should refer to in your code are the ones Prefixed with Dagger for your component.

Using Dagger In Your Build

Gradle Users

You will need to include the dagger-2.2.jar in your application’s runtime. In order to activate code generation you will need to include dagger-compiler-2.2.jar in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section of your pom.xml, and the dagger-compiler artifact as a dependency of the compiler plugin:

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
